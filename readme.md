# HTML practice for TOP

Simple site used to practice very basic use of HTML and a little brush with CSS. Learning fast but still a long ways to go. Up until recently I had no interest at all in webdev. This stuff is becoming quite addictive.The programming doesn't bother me. I know C#, Python, have a vague memory of C,  and am eager to learn JS. I have been for some time. But this flexbox man. Yikes. Couple that with my absolute terror and distaste for anything GUI, and I've got a problem. I plan to focus mostly on the backend, and most likely with a stronger emphasis on Python since I've become quite familiar wiht the concepts of Blueprints and the Flask framework. However I may just as easily become obsessed with JS. It's early and as of now I am enjoying this ride. 

Can't seem to get the style sheet to load on my desktop.. doesn't want to find it I even added the CSS to the recipes directory but it is lost on desktop. I know none will see this but it's driving me insane.. lol.
