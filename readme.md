# HTML practice for TOP

Simple site used to practice very basic use of HTML and a little brush with CSS. Learning fast but still a long ways to go. Up until recently I had no interest at all in webdev. This stuff is becoming quite addictive.The programming doesn't bother me. I know C#, Python, have a vague memory of C,  and am eager to learn JS. I have been for some time. But this flexbox man. Yikes. Couple that with my absolute terror and distaste for anything GUI, and I've got a problem. I plan to focus mostly on the backend, and most likely with a stronger emphasis on Python since I've become quite familiar wiht the concepts of Blueprints and the Flask framework. However I may just as easily become obsessed with JS. It's early and as of now I am enjoying this ride. 

THe fact that the CSS file for the recipes can't be found is stupid. It works on my computer all day long and Ive edited the link in every possible imaginable way. I even added a copy of the stupid file to the recipes directory... guess what? still doesnt work.
