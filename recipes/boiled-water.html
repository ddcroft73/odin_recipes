                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>A skill every chef must learn! I know it seems nearly impossible, but with this foolproof recipe, you'll be boiling water so well Ramasay himself will seek you out!</p>
                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 cups of hot water.</li>
                        <li>1 vessel in which to make the magic happen.</li>
                        <li>1.5 cup of cold water.</li>
                        <li>A heat source. A stove works fine.</li>
                        <li>A bit of patience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add the 4 cups of warm water to your vessel. A pot is usually the goto in this application, but if all you have is a kettle, that works too. Stay away from any flammable or material that may melt.</li>
                        <li>Place your pot, kettle, what have you on the heat source and turn the dial to Hi.</li>
                        <li>Add the remaining cold water to the pot.</li>
                        <li>In about 7 minutes you will be amazed at the results! Enjoy.</li>
                        <li>Do NOT watch the pot. It is a little known fact, the water will not boil if you do not turn your back.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>Authors' Notes:</h3>
                    <p>Currently I am working on a "set it and forget it" method. A slow cooker would make this recipe so much easier!</p>
