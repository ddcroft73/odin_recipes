                    <li>Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if any left) into the sink. Ice will spoil if left longer than 3 days.</li>

                </ol>

                <p>Make 100% sure you employ the freezer for this recipe. The refridgerator sadly, just results in a very runny product.</p>
