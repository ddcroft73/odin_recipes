                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>I shouldn't be making this family secret known, but it's just not fair to keep this to myself!</p>
                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sliced bread. White is typically best, but you can be adventurous. </li>
                        <li>A long stick with which to hold said bread.</li>
                        <li>A heat source. Usually an open flame will serve you best. </li>
                        <li>A keen eye. </li>
                        <li>A little hope!  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Skewer the bread so that it can hang freely.</li>
                        <li>Build a nice fire form which to cook. I reccomend outdoors. (maybe this should have been 1?)</li>
                        <li>Hold the bread above the fire and pay attention. There is a fine line between toast, and burnt!</li>
                        <li>A little hope and a keen eye and you'll be dining in style in no time!.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Authors' Notes:</h3>
                    <p>I have heard others speak of a fancy machine that will actually do this for you, but that would take out the skill and the pride of making your own DRY toast!</p>
